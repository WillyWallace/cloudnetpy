# Cloudnet
The Cloudnet python package is a software for producing vertical profiles of cloud properties. Cloudnet processing combines (pre-processed) cloud radar, optical lidar, microwave radiometer and model data. The measurements (and model data) are brought into common grid and classified (ice, liquid, aerosol, insects, ect.). Then, geophysical products such as ice water content are retrieved.
```diff
- Cloudnet python package is currently under heavy development - it is not yet a working software.
