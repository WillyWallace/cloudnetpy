# Cloudnet
The Cloudnet python package is a library for producing vertical profiles of cloud properties from ground-based remote sensing measurements. Cloudnet processing combines (pre-processed) cloud radar, optical lidar, microwave radiometer and model data. The measurements (and model data) are brought into common grid and classified (ice, liquid, aerosol, insects, ect.). Then, geophysical products such as ice water content are retrieved in further processing steps.

The Cloudnet python package is a refactored fork of the currently operational processing code written in Matlab.

```diff
- Cloudnet python package is currently under heavy development. It does not yet produces any 
- meaninful results and should not be used for any serious scientific work.
