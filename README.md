# Cloudnet
The Cloudnet package is a python library for Cloudnet data processing. Cloudnet processing combines (pre-processed) cloud radar, optical lidar, microwave radiometer and model data. The measurements (and model data) are brought into common grid and classified (ice, liquid, aerosol, insects, ect.). Then, geophysical products such as ice water content are retrieved.
```diff
