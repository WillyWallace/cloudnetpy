# CloudnetPy
CloudnetPy is a python library for producing vertical profiles of cloud properties from ground-based remote sensing measurements. The Cloudnet processing combines (pre-processed) cloud radar, optical lidar, microwave radiometer and model data. The measurements and model data are brought into common grid and classified as ice, liquid, aerosol, insects, ect. Then, geophysical products such as ice water content are retrieved in further processing steps.

CloudnetPy is a refactored fork of the currently operational processing code written in Matlab.
The python version will eventually be a major upgrade due to numerous updated methods, extensive documentation, and more.

```diff
- CloudnetPy is currently under heavy development. It does not yet 
- produce any meaninful results and should not be used for serious scientific work.
